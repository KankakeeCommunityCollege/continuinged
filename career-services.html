  Switch tabs from hard-coded HTML to collections based tabs:
  
    1. Configure tabs collection in `config.yml`
    2. Convert HTML tabs to `_tabs/*.md` collection.
    3. Replace all that HTML with `{% include tabbed-content.html %}`

                <p>After a seasonal work layoff, Jon Meyer decided to go back to school. He enrolled in KCC&rsquo;s Manufacturing Technology program.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;During the last semester I was enrolled at KCC I was required to complete a Capstone course called The BSNS 2423 Internship Experience. Luckily, I had found employment at Yoshino America Corporation, a bottling company in University Park, just before enrolling in this course. My position at the company is a Maintenance Technician. I am responsible for keeping all equipment in the building running at 100%.My official internship experience lasted sixteen weeks. During this time I had 4 evaluations of my performance, and worked closely with KCC and my employer to incorporate all the knowledge I had gained. All my supervisors worked hard to assist with the internship and were excited about what I could bring to the company. All requirements of the internship were able to be fulfilled through my regular work requirements while continuing through my final 18 credit hour semester.</p>
                <p>My knowledge gained at KCC has not only given me an edge but made me a force to be reckoned with. I feel that at this point there is nothing I can&rsquo;t build, repair, wire, program, or troubleshoot. If there is a task I am not sure about how to complete, my skills can guide me to find a way to complete it correctly.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Going to KCC was the best decision I have ever made. It will forever change my life and the lives of my family. I couldn&rsquo;t be happier with all the knowledge I gained.&rdquo;</p>
