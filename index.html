          <p>We'll put a happy little sky in here. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree.</p>
          <p>This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. This is truly an almighty mountain. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.</p>
          <p>Let's make a happy little mountain now. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown.</p>
          <p>All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. There we go. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that.</p>
          <p>The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting.</p>
          <p>If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. There we go. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow.</p>
          <p>Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll.</p>
          <p>Just beat the devil out of it. Put it in, leave it alone. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it.</p>
          <p>The least little bit can do so much. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. Anything you want to do you can do here.</p>
          <p>Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera.</p>
          <p>It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it.</p>
          <p>You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective.</p>
          <p>A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. This is a fantastic little painting. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so.</p>
          <p>The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics.</p>
          <p>Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people.</p>
          <p>See there how easy that is. That's crazy. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. See there, told you that would be easy. There comes a nice little fluffer.</p>
